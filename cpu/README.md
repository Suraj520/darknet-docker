darknet-docker/cpu
=========================
Nothing fancy in this image - it is here for consitency with the rest and to save you time of having to compile darknet (YOLO) yourself.

Running
-------
Since this is a CPU-based image, you can just use the regular docker command:

```
docker run --rm -it jcjimenez/darknet-docker:cpu-latest
```
